
The grizzly project family provides services for time tracking, quick integration with project management, invoicing, and the occasional data mining.

The Server Aspect
=================
The server aspect of this project handles the invoice generation, project management integration, and out of band editing. The protocol for syncing the server aspect with the other aspects is documented in the SYNCING document.

The server aspect should provide an interface for resolving conflicts across different reporting devices.

The Desktop Aspect
==================
The desktop aspect provides a desktop widget for quick entry of time logs into the system. It should also remind the user every N minutes of the current log.

The Android Aspect
==================
The android aspect provides an 'on-the-go' solution for time logging. It should provide a similar interface as the desktop interface.
